## py-bchain

this repo is for learning purpouse, code is all based on:

- [article](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46)
- [code](https://github.com/dvf/blockchain?ref=hackernoon.com)

The idea is to undestand how blockchain works using python that is a easier lang to read and after undestanding, implement it in rust (fast and reliable as they say).



```python
$ pip install requirements.txt
$ python lib.py -p 5000
```
